                    Authentication & Authorization

- Authentication is the process of verifying user credentials.
  [userid, password, security token etc..]
- Authorization is the process of restricting access to resources.

                            Cookies
- Cookie is a simple text document used to store client details on client device.
- Cookie is a state management technique used in web applications, where you can store data and use across requests.
- It is a client side state management technique.
- Cookies are classified into 2 types
    a) In-memory cookie [ temporary ]
    b) Persistent cookie [permanent]
- JavaScript can manipulate cookies using  "document.cookie".
- React requires 3 party cookie libraries.

                             React-Cookie
- It is a 3rd party cookie service.
- It requires a Provider and Injector.

        <CookieProvider>            Provider
        useCookies()                Injector

1. Install cookie library

        > npm  i  react-cookie --save

2. Configure cookie provider in "index.js"

import { CookiesProvider } from 'react-cookie';

<CookiesProvider>
    <App />
</CookiesProvider>

3. To Access and manipulate  cookie you need  an Injector  "useCookies()"

    const [get, set, delete] = useCookies();

Ex:
    const [cookies, setCookie, removeCookie] = useCookies('name');

    cookies['name']                             => access cookie value
    setCookie('name', value, { expires : date })        => create & store value
    removeCookie('name')                        => delete a cookie

        - It keeps the data in client memory until removed explicitly.
        - It is accessible across browser tabs.
        - It is available even when the browser is closed.
    b) SessionStorage
        - It is temporary
