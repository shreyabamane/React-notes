Database - MongoDB

                                    API
                    [ Application Programming Interface ]

Distributed Computing:
- Distributed computing allows 2 different applications running on 2 different devices to share information.
- It also allows 2 different objects running in 2 different process of same device to share information.
- There are various distributed computing technologies for different types of languages and frameworks

            CORBA
            DCOM
            RMI
            EJB
            Web Service
            Remoting
            etc..

Web Service:
- Web Service is distributed computing technology know to many languages and frameworks.
- Web Service uses 3 specifications for communication

        a) SOAP
        b) REST
        c) JSON

SOAP
- Service Oriented Architecture Protocol
- Service consumer makes XML request
- Service provider sends XML response

    Request:
    <Appointments>
        <Appointment>
        <UserId>Sam_NIT</UserId>
       </Appointment>
       </Appointments>

    Response:
    <Appointments>
        <Appointment>
           ... all details...
        </Appointment>
        ... all appointments..
    </Appointments>

REST:
- Representational State Transfer
- Service consumer will make a query request
- Servicer provider will send an XML response or JSON response.

    Request:
    http://some.domain.com/appointments?user_id=sam_nit
   
    Response:
          <Appointments>                [
          <Appointment>                  {
            ....                             "Appointment_Id" : 2,
              </Appointment>                     "Title" : " ",
        </Appointments>                         "User_Id": "sam_nit"
                                       },
                                    ]
   
JSON:
- JavaScript Object Notation
- Service consumer will make a JSON request.
- Service provider will send an JSON response.

Request:
        {
         User_Id: "sam_nit"
        }

Response:        
        [
          {
          }
        ]

Issues with Web Service:
- It can run only over "HTTP"
- It is primarly based on SOAP.
- It returns only XML.
- It can be hosted only of Webservers.

Solution
- API
- Application Programming Interface
- It introduces REST full services.
- It returns XML & JSON.
- It runs over various protocols.
- It is cross platform.
- It can reach any device & OS services. [Primary aim]
- It can run on low band width devices.

       
                              Business Logic
                                      [ API ]
- Application runs on "Tiers".
    a) Presentation Tier
    b) Application Tier
    c) Database Tier
- Application is built on "Layers"
    a) UI Layer
    b) Business Layer [Express JS, Node JS]
    c) Data Layer
