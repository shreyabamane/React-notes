   - Application starts with "index.html" [public]
   - Code for index.html comes from "index.js" [src]
   - index.js is using a component "<App>" to render into index.html
   - <App> component code is defined in "App.js"

    <div id="root"> </div>            => index.html

     const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root");
     root.render( <App /> )
