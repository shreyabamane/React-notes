- Node JS
- Express JS

Node JS
- It is built on google chrome v8 compiler.
- It is Javascript based server side technology.
- Server side scripting is a technique where scripts are employed on server inorder to generate a response customized to every client request.
- Node JS provides a set of server side objects, which are responsible for handling interactions on server.

            - path
            - os [Operating System]
            - fs [File Stream]
            - http

Features of Node JS:
- It is single threaded.
- It is modular.
- Application specific framework or library is used.
- Light weight
- Faster
- It doesn't use caching. [Buffering]
- It gets data in form of memory packets.

Express JS:
- It is a middleware framework.
- It is Javascript based.
- Middleware is a software framework that handle communication between computers in network.
- It is responsible for
        a) Configuring Server to host API
        b) Handle request from client
        c) Send html, xml, file, json response to client.
        d) Parsing the data
        etc..

Create Server Side App:

1. Install Express JS in your project

    > npm  i  express --save

2. Import express library - Node uses "require()" method to import library.

    var express = require("express");

3. Create server side app with express

    var app = express();        

4. Server side app requires routing to configure

    app.get("/path", function(request, response){

        })

    - request object provides properties and methods that are used to access data
      from client, which can be from query string, formbody, cookies etc.

    - response object provides properties and method that are used to send response
      to client, which can be html, json, file, xml etc.

Syntax:
    app.get("/", (req, res)=>{
          res.send("data");
          res.end();
    })

5. Application starts on local server at specific port number by using "listen()".

    app.listen(8080);
   
    http://127.0.0.1:8080            -> server app

Note: Node JavaScript can't have any DOM methods. It uses Javascript console and language features.

                    api.js

var express = require("express");

var app = express();

app.get("/",(req, res)=>{
    res.send("<h2>Welcome to API's</h2>");
    res.end();
});

app.get("/categories",(req, res)=>{
    res.send([{CategoryId:1, CategoryName:"Electronics"},{CategoryId:2, CategoryName:"Fashion"}]);
    res.end();
});

app.get("/products", (req, res)=>{
    res.send(
        <Products>
            <Product>
                <Id>1</Id>
                <Name>TV</Name>
            </Product>
            <Product>
                <Id>2</Id>
                <Name>Mobile</Name>
            </Product>
        </Products>
    );
    res.end();
});

app.get("*",(req, res)=>{
    res.send("Not Found - 404");
    res.end();
});

app.listen(7000);
console.log("Server Started http://127.0.0.1:7000&quot;);

6. Run node program

        > node  api.js
